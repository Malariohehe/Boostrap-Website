				<div class = "col-6 border border-dark">Why this Pokemon? <p>
					Dragapult is by far my favorite Pokemon form Sword and Sheild. It's a speed special attacker
					that can take care of most other Pokemon with it's wide coverage of moves. On top of that as a ghost dragon
					normal and fighting types no longer affect it, which means it's a good switch when a super effective fighting type is 
					expected for a move, making the switch to nullify any damage. I enjoy this mon mostly because 
					it's design is extremely appealing, but not only that. It is also a very viable Pokemon, not only in competitive, 
					but also in just normal run throughs of the game (even though the encounter is in one specific spot in the game, with a 
					specific weather condition at a 2% encounter rate.). As well as this Pokemon's high speed, It also has the capability to 
					hit a Pokemon multiple times in one move with it's special attack dragon darts, making this pokemon 
					a very viable focus sash breaker/sturdy breaker. The over all design is fairly simple, while also having components 
					from previous evolutions, such as the first evolution being launched out of it's head catapult as an attack, while also maintaining 
					a completely different form. It's no wonder why when they introduced this Pokemon as the Psudo-Legendary 
					of the region people liked it pretty much immidiatly. Overall, this Pokemon is great for it's speed, 
					and takes great advantage of that fact using it's speed to outdo foes. Not only this but it has great special attack 
					making it great for wipping low special deffense teams.
