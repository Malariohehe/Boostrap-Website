				<div class = "col-6 border border-dark">About Me <p>Hello! And welcome to this new website.
					I created this site to share my pasion for the popular video game series Pokemon.
					But before we get to that i'll tell you how this game sparked my intrests.
					When I was about 6 or 7 I owned a Nintendo DS Lite, it had a slot at the bottom to input 
					Gameboy cartridges. My older brother just so happened to have the cartridge for Pokemon Saphire.
					I begged him to let me play it and after a while he grew tired of playing the game, so I had taken it to play myself
					. That was my first time playing the game but I can still remember the joy of starting it up,
					with the Gameboy jingle playing as it started up. I sucked at it, but got better as time passed.
					and now I land here, where I have played many of the games, conducted shiny hunts, replayed, even taken on 
					unique sets of rules called nuzlocke rules where if a pokemon faints you have to box it permanantly.
					Even playing fan-made games with interesting spins on the story and new pokemon people created.
