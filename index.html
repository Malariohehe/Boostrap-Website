				<div class = "col-6 border border-dark">About Me <p>Hello! And welcome to this new website.
					I created this site to share my passion for the popular video game series Pokemon, aswell as some other things in the future. 
					But before we get to that i'll tell you how this game sparked my intrests.
					When I was about 6 or 7 I owned a Nintendo DS Lite, it had a slot at the bottom to input 
					Gameboy cartridges. My older brother just so happened to have the cartridge for Pokemon Saphire.
					I begged him to let me play it and after a while he grew tired of playing the game, so I had taken it to play myself
					. That was my first time playing the game but I can still remember the joy of starting it up,
					with the Gameboy jingle playing as it started up. I sucked at it, but got better as time passed.
					and now I land here, where I have played many of the games, conducted shiny hunts, replayed, even taken on 
					unique sets of rules called nuzlocke rules where if a pokemon faints you have to box it permanantly.
					Even playing fan-made games with interesting spins on the story and new pokemon people created. Which now
					 brings me to the topic of this site.

				<div class = "col-6 border border-dark">About This Page <p>On this site i've decided on adding tabs about things
					that intrest me or got me into things that I currently like.The first thing I have decided to add 
					is a list of my top six favorite pokemon (since six usually make up a party) as well as a competitive play guide 
					which will be a video at the end once you're done with the rest of my site. I will also be including 
					each pokemons stats as well as talking about a general competitive setup for them, which may not be very good 
					since I suck at comp. I still try to play quite frequently just to improve my self at it, as the saying goes "If at first
					you don't succeed, try try again." It never hurts to continue polishing skills as long as you have the means to do so 
					on your own. I remember facing my brother, who used a comp team all the time and losing, but still 
					I tryed over and over again convinced that I could on day beat him at the game he enjoyed to much. 
					Still to this day, I have never beaten him in a battle, but I would love to challenge him again sometime 
					to show him the improvement I have made.
